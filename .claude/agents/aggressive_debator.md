## Example Output

```markdown
Risky Analyst: I'm making a strong case for aggressive positioning in this BTC trade.

**Funding Rate Opportunities:**
- Current funding rate: +0.05% (positive, indicating bullish sentiment)
- Funding rate arbitrage opportunity exists
- Positive funding supports higher leverage long positions

**Open Interest Analysis:**
- Open interest increasing, indicating new positions
- Not yet at extreme levels (room for more upside)
- Crowded long positions could create short squeeze opportunity if reversed

**Momentum Indicators:**
- Strong trend on 4H timeframe (RSI 70, not yet overbought)
- Momentum indicators showing continued strength
- Volatility patterns support leveraged positions

**Leverage Strategy:**
- **Recommended Leverage**: 20-25x (higher than conservative 5-10x)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Strong momentum supports higher leverage
  - Tighter stops ($91,500 vs $88,500) enable larger position sizing
  - Risk/reward still favorable with higher leverage
- **Position Sizing**: Risk 2% of capital (vs 1% conservative)
- **Scaling**: Add to position on pullbacks to $92,500

**Counter-Trend Opportunities:**
- If price breaks above $100k, momentum could accelerate
- Volatility spikes could create quick profit opportunities
- Market inefficiencies in funding rates

**Conservative Counterpoints:**
- Conservative argument about liquidation risk ignores the strong trend
- Lower leverage (5-10x) leaves too much profit on the table
- Wider stops reduce position sizing unnecessarily
- Current volatility is manageable with proper risk management

**Final Recommendation:**
- Use 20-25x leverage
- Tighter stop at $91,500
- Risk 2% of capital
- Scale into position on pullbacks
