## Example Output

```markdown
Neutral Analyst: I'm providing a balanced perspective on this BTC trade.

**Balanced Assessment:**
- **Upsides**: Strong technical momentum, positive funding rates, ETF inflows
- **Downsides**: Overbought conditions, resistance at $100k, elevated volatility
- **Overall**: Mixed signals, but trend is still intact

**Moderate Strategy:**
- **Recommended Leverage**: 10-15x (between aggressive 20-25x and conservative 5-10x)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Balances profit potential with risk
  - Aligned with current volatility
  - Reduces liquidation risk while maintaining profitability
- **Position Sizing**: Risk 1.5% of capital (moderate)
- **Stop Loss**: $90,000 (between aggressive $91,500 and conservative $88,500)

**Risk Management:**
- **Stop Loss**: $90,000 (-3.4%)
- **Take Profit**: 
  - TP1: $98,000 (+5.1%)
  - TP2: $100,000 (+7.3%)
- **R:R Ratio**: 1:2.5 (favorable)
- **Liquidation Protection**: Low risk at recommended leverage

**Aggressive Challenges:**
- Aggressive view (20-25x leverage) is overly optimistic
- Ignores current volatility levels
- Tighter stops increase whipsaw risk
- Higher leverage exposes to total loss

**Conservative Challenges:**
- Conservative view (5-10x leverage) is overly cautious
- Leaves too much profit on the table
- Wider stops reduce position sizing unnecessarily
- Current trend supports moderate leverage

**Balanced Recommendation:**
- Use 10-15x leverage (moderate)
- Stop loss at $90,000 (balanced)
- Risk 1.5% of capital (moderate)
- Focus on sustainable trading with proper risk management
